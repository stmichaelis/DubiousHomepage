DubiousHomepage
===============

This project started as the base for a personal homepage. The
fundamentals used are Mirah for the programming language and Dubious
for web framework. Mirah and Dubious are both evolving heavily and
therefore this example may provide a starting point for similar
projects.

As a prerequisite you need to install [Dubious](https://github.com/mirah/dubious)
I recommend using the Gem in JRuby. The website has been tested with
the Gem version 0.0.2.

Experiments in this application include:

* HTML5/CSS3 elements like section, rounded borders, transparency.
* JQuery for dynamic page loading and animations hiding/showing
certain elements.
* Dynamic hyphenation via JavaScript.
* Webfonts for the main heading
* Language detection (German/English) and redirect based on
preferences in http header
